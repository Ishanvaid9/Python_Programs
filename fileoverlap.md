# File Overlap  
## Problem

Given two _.txt_ files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping. [One .txt file](http://www.practicepython.org/assets/primenumbers.txt) has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the [other .txt file](http://www.practicepython.org/assets/happynumbers.txt) has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.

(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that can’t be divided by any other number. And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number). The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)

### Discussion

You’ll need to stitch together a few ideas of things I’ve previously talked about on this blog, so if you need a refresher in any of these topics, now is your chance! Of course, there are any number of ways to do this exercise, so these are only suggestions.

Topics:

1. Reading a file, in [Exercise 21](readfromfile.md)
2. Number types and converting to integers from strings, in [Exercise 1](characterinput.md)
3. Lists, in [Exercise 3]() and [Exercise 5]()
